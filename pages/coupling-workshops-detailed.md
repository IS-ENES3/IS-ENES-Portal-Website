### <a name="CW2010"></a>First Workshop on Coupling Technologies for Earth System Models (CW2010)

CERFACS and the Georgia Institute of Technology organized a workshop on the theme of “Coupling Technologies for Earth System Modelling : Today and Tomorrow”. The first thrust of the workshop was to assess the state of the art in ESM coupling frameworks. The second thrust was to discuss a vision for coupling in the year 2020. 

Discussions from this workshop resulted in a review paper on the state of the art, entitled [Coupling Technologies for Earth System Modelling](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/5/1589/2012/gmd-5-1589-2012.html) (in Geosci. Model Dev., 5, 1589-1596, 2012).

### <a name="IWGCW"></a>International Working Committee on Coupling Technologies

The International Working Committee on Coupling Technologies (IWCCT) organizes global efforts related to the characterization, comparison, and benchmarking of Earth system model coupling technologies.

IWCCT leads international workshops that promote dialogue among groups engaged in developing model coupling technologies and infrastructure. These workshops are being held about every other year (see list of workshops above).

Discussions from the 2010 workshop resulted in a review paper on the state of the art, entitled [Coupling Technologies for Earth System Modelling](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/5/1589/2012/gmd-5-1589-2012.html) (in Geosci. Model Dev., 5, 1589-1596, 2012).
