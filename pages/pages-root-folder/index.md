## Welcome to the ENES Portal

### The European Network for Earth System Modelling

The European Network for Earth System modelling, ENES, was launched in 2001. It gathers ~ 50 groups from the academic, public, and industrial world and is the initiator of many projects and initiatives in the field of European Earth system modeling.

Upon the establishment of the network and in the following years, several institutions including university departments, research centres, meteorological services, computer centres, and industrial partners, agreed to work together and cooperate (see Memorandum of Understanding) to discuss strategies to accelerate progress in climate and Earth system modelling and understanding.

ENES aims to:
1.	Help in the development and evaluation of state-of-the-art climate and Earth system models,
2.	Facilitate focused model intercomparisons in order to assess and improve these models,
3.	Encourage exchanges of software and model results, 
4.	Help in the development of high-performance computing facilities dedicated to long high-resolution, multi-model ensemble integrations.

This portal, established and maintained by IS-ENES (Infrastructure for ENES), aims to provide the European Earth system modeling community with information on ENES projects in the field of climate and Earth system modeling. 

It also provides information on where to access key data and software resources of the ENES Research Infrastructure. These services are provided through the IS-ENES projects, complemented by ESIWACE services focusing on enhancing performance on High-performance computers.
