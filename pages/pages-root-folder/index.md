## Welcome to the ENES Portal
### Infrastructure for the European Network for Earth System Modelling (2019 - 2022)

IS-ENES3, an Horizon 2020 project, is the third phase of the distributed e-infrastructure of the European Network for Earth System Modelling (ENES).

The project fosters collaboration between twenty-two European climate research institutions.

The community aims to develop a better understanding of past and present-day climate and to project future variability and changes through the development and sharing of model components, modelling tools and data infrastructure.

The IS-ENES3 three main objectives are to: 
- Foster collaboration among the modelling groups to speed-up the development and use of models of the complex Earth’s climate system, namely “Earth System models” (ESMs)
- Deliver common strategies for the research infrastructure
- Disseminate model data
