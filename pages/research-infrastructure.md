## Research Infrastructure

**Climate modelling depends on a significant amount of infrastructure**: from the models themselves to the computing and data infrastructure. This tripod of models, computing, and data – with all the connecting workflow, network, and tools – needs to be well documented and depends on the central role of people with expertise in climate science, model and software development. 



**The strategy documents** present the strategy of the ENES research infrastructure. They have been elaborated as part of the IS-ENES projects and encompass recommendations for the different components of ENES research infrastructure. 

**The EU funded IS-ENES projects**, the “*InfraStructure for the European Network for Earth System modelling*”, launched in 2009, aim at further integrating the climate modelling and facilitate access to climate model data from international experiments and to software.  Since 2015, IS-ENES activities are complemented by the **EU funded ESIWACE projects**, the “*Center of Excellence in Simulation for Weather and Climate in Europe*”, with a focus on high-performance computing. 

ENES research infrastructure provides a range of services through its funded projects IS-ENES and ESiWACE.
