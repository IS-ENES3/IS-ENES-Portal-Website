Following its missions, ENES has developed services to facilitate access to climate model data from model intercomparison projects. 

As quoted in the ENES infrastructure strategy of 2012: 

 *“Model Inter-comparison Projects (or MIPs) provide three key tools for improving and exploiting Earth system models: methods of evaluating model skill (in comparative terms), methods of improving complex process understanding, and finally, of providing projections for the future”*


**[Access to WCRP internationally coordinated experiments](https://is-enes3.github.io/IS-ENES-Website/services-data-metadata/)**, extensively used in IPCC Assessment reports: 

-	**CMIP**: simulations with global climate models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3, CMIP5, CMIP6), and
-	**CORDEX**: simulations with regional climate models, downscaled from CMIP simulations, of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiments (CORDEX-CMIP5)
As part of the **H2020 IS-ENES3 project**

**Training and youtube tutorials are also available on [IS-ENES3 project website](https://is-enes3.github.io/IS-ENES-Website/training/)**


Other intercomparison projects:

-	**[DYAMOND](https://www.esiwace.eu/services/dyamond-initiative)**, first intercomparison of global storm-resolving models
As part of the **H2020 ESiWACE2 project**
