### <a name="esm2025"></a>ESM2025 (06/2021 – 05/2025)

**Earth system models for the future**
Coord: Météo-France (FR), Roland Séférian

EU-funded ESM2025 is an ambitious European research project on Earth system numerical modelling that will focus on the representation of interactions and couplings between Earth system model (ESM) components to improve key climate processes and better represent the full Earth system response to anthropogenic emissions and land-use change. ESM2025 will also take a step forward in providing relevant climate simulations for the development of ambitious and realistic mitigation and adaptation strategies in line with the Paris Agreement, by improving the physical coherence of climate and mitigation processes in ESMs and integrated assessment models. Expected project results will support international climate assessment reports (e.g. IPCC), climate change mitigation policy, climate change adaptation and local and national decision-making.

20 partners, 9 countries
